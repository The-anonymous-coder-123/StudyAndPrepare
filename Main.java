//RULES
//No deletion of any Syntax
//Useful text only
//please put the syntax in the correct chapter file. if there is no chapter file, create one.
//THIS IS NOT A SOCIAL AREA! if you have friends to talk to, go somewhere else.
//This is not meant to function as a program. please refrain from running it. it ruins it for everyone.
//LINKS ARE A PRIVELEGE, NOT A RIGHT. you may post links to java-related things. 
//NO BULLYING. this means:
  //no making fun of others
  //no teasing others
  //no excluding others
  //NO REMOVING OTHERS WORK
//I will be starting to experiment with the Unity game engine(it uses java). if you wish to help, please email me at park_nic000@battlegroundps.org, or crazykitchen124@gmail.com
//if there is a typo please notify me or one of the teachers
//requests for more detail are available.

//Basic Java Techniuques (pay attention to caps)
  //Class Names
    // MyClassName
  //Method Names
    // myMethodName
  //Constant Names
    // MY_CONSTANT_NAME

/*Basic rules of thumb: (feel free to add some)
  -Names are everything
  -when in doubt, map it out
  -if you are making a variable for a specific method, try to name them the same
  -SEMICOLONS
  -always import. even if its not needed, it gives you more options.
  -indentation helps you see what is what. so if you see a "{", indent on the next line.
