//RULES
//No deletion of any Syntax
//Useful text only
//please put the syntax in the correct chapter file. if there is no chapter file, create one.
//THIS IS NOT A SOCIAL AREA! if you have friends to talk to, go somewhere else.
//This is not meant to function as a program. please refrain from running it. it ruins it for everyone.
//LINKS ARE A PRIVELEGE, NOT A RIGHT. you may post links to java-related things. 
//NO BULLYING. this means:
  //no making fun of others
  //no teasing others
  //no excluding others
  //NO REMOVING OTHERS WORK
//I will be starting to experiment with the Unity game engine(it uses java). if you wish to help, please email me at park_nic000@battlegroundps.org, or crazykitchen124@gmail.com
//if there is a typo please notify me or one of the teachers
//requests for more detail are available.

//Basic Java Techniuques (pay attention to caps)
  //Class Names
    // MyClassName
  //Method Names
    // myMethodName
  //Variable Names:note how the words are shortened.
    // myVarName
  //Constant Names
    // MY_CONSTANT_NAME

/*Basic rules of thumb: (feel free to add some)
  -Names are everything
  -when in doubt, map it out
  -if you are making a variable for a specific method, try to name them similarly
  -SEMICOLONS
  -always import. even if its not needed, it gives you more options.
  -indentation helps you see what is what. so if you see a "{", indent on the next line.
  -

/*TERMINOLOGY (pronounciation is based on how I sound them out in my head. if its wrong, or you would like to update it to be dictionarily correct, go ahead)
    - Coord(s) [Koh-oards]: abbreviation for Co-ordinates, a system to count units in an image or predetermined digital area.
    - Max Int:  a refrence to the largest number java can compute: 2147483647 [Two billion, one-hundred forty-seven million, four hundred eighty-three thousand, six hundred and forty-seven]
    - encapsulation [In-caps-you-lay-shon]: privatization of custom class variables (and thier subclasses) using the "private" keyword
    - statement: a line of code that performs a specified action. will always end in a semicolon
    - memory leak: memory that is assigned to a specific function, but is never used if the function doesnt close. typically orginates from unterminated scanner variables.
    - bug: an error in the logic or syntax of the program, and the bane of most programmer's existence.
      -coined after a literal bug was found in early computer. it was a moth.
    - coffee: a refrence to the language at hand. also the only thing that keeps most programmers awake.
    - syntax [sin-tax]: the closing and appropriate assignment of logics, usually signified by variables and (), [], or {}
    - PDT: Primitive Data Type. refers to int, char, String, and boolean data types 
    - Auto-Initialization [Auto-initial-I-zAsh-un]: the initialization of variables to a default value, such as on an array's elements when it is constructed.
    - null [nuhll]: a special constant equating to zero in non-numerical data types.
      -when notch was coding minecraft, he attempted to set the "air" to null, but the game kept crashing. lesson? null is a bad thing to have 9 times out of 10.
    - abstract: the concept of the subject in question bieng in a state of psuedo-existence in code. typically found in methods declared in interfaces.


//NOTEs
//if you want to save your eyes from the Red Squiggles Of Doom, turn off code intelligence.
//please do not fork this, as it is not complete, and is meant for the entire class, as well as anyone who wants to learn about java.
//in this replit, there will be syntaxes with variables tools, algorithms and such,
//text surrounded by <> are variables to be determined while writing it.
//text surrounded by [], unless used in Arrays, are variables or values seperate from the algorithm or tool, but needed for it to function.


//NAVIGATION
//any concept or statement is in its respective chapter. ex: class construction is in ChReview/ChEight.java

//if you have any questions, please put them below.
